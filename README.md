_A personal journey in organizing thoughts and uncovering writing patterns through code_

## About this project üîç

I created this personalized diary system to:
- üìÖ Automatically organize daily entries in chronological structure with easy finding system
- üá∫üá¶üá¨üáß Handle multilingual content
- Generate visual insights from my writing patterns
- Experiment with text analysis techniques

What started as a simple note organizer evolved into an exploration of natural language processing and much more is awaiting.

## Key Features

### Diary Core
- **Automatic folder structure**  
  `~/diary/YYYY-MM/YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- **Markdown timestamps**  
  ```markdown
  ## 14:30
  –°—å–æ–≥–æ–¥–Ω—ñ –≤–∏–≤—á–∞–ª–∞ –Ω–æ–≤—ñ –∫–æ–Ω—Ü–µ–ø—Ü—ñ—ó –º–∞—à–∏–Ω–Ω–æ–≥–æ –Ω–∞–≤—á–∞–Ω–Ω—è
  ```
  It helps to save multiple entries from one day in single markdown note.

### Text analysis
- **Bilingual word clouds**  
  Visual representations of the language landscape
- **Frequency analysis**  
  Discover which concepts dominate your thoughts
- **Stop-words**  
  Separate stopword lists for Ukrainian and English (so it doesn't count trashy words).

## Tech Stack üíª

```python
# Core components
from pathlib import Path  # File system 
from datetime import datetime  # Timem
import re  # Text cleaning ninja

# Analysis components
from collections import Counter  # counting guru
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  # visualization
from wordcloud import WordCloud  #  word counting secret

# GUI
from tkinter import ttk, scrolledtext, messagebox
```


## Future I'd like to develope

- [ ] **PDF Export**  
  Create beautiful monthly recap documents, conversion to pdf and more file handling
- [ ] **Topic modeling and more language analysis**  
  Auto-discover recurring themes with LDA; more exciting word analysis
- [ ] **Writing habit tracker**  
  Analyze the most productive times/days/seasons
- [ ] ~**GUI interface**~ **Updated and more cool GUI**  
  I implemented the most basic GUI but much more could be done
- [ ] **Wrap up an application**

## Why I Built This

1. **Organization** - Clean structure brings peace of mind
2. **Project to develope some programming skills** - I simply wanted to practice some python
3. **Data** - Numbers that tell stories about yourSELF
